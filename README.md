  ## Introduction:
  Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) is a sum of money required from bidders as a commitment to participate seriously. It serves as financial assurance and is typically a percentage of the bid amount or a fixed amount. The EMD is held by the government agency or organization conducting the bidding/auction. If the bidder wins but fails to fulfil contractual obligations, the EMD may be forfeited. Understanding EMD requirements is crucial for bidders.
